## Business Problem

This case study is centered around a fictional online food store.  The founder of the company wants to analyse customer data to find creative solutions to calculate funnel fallout rates.  

## Data

The founder has provided five datasets: `users`, `events`, `campaign_identifier`, `page_identifier`, `event_identifier`.  To demonstrate the relationship between the tables, I have created the Entity Relationship Diagram below using the [DB Diagram tool](https://dbdiagram.io/home).  I have analysed the data using PostgreSQL 13 and you can view it at [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/jmnwogTsUE8hGqkZv9H7E8/17).

## Questions & Analysis

## Part 1: Digital Analysis

**1. How many users are there?**

To find the total number of users, I ran a simple **COUNT (DISTINCT)** function
````
SELECT
	COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS total_users
FROM	clique_bait.users;
````

| total_users |
| ----------- |
| 500         |


***

**2. How many cookies does each user have on average?**

I created a cte table to first count the number of cookies per users.  I then averaged these results with a seperate **SELECT** statement.  I rounded the result to the nearest whole number because it isn't possible to have anything less than a whole cookie.  

````
    WITH user_count AS (
    
    	SELECT COUNT(cookie_id) AS cookie_count 
    	FROM clique_bait.users
    	GROUP BY (user_id))
       	
        
    SELECT ROUND(AVG(cookie_count),0) AS avg_cookies_per_user
    FROM user_count;
````

| avg_cookies_per_user |
| -------------------- |
| 4                    |


***

**3. What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?**

In order to group results by month, I used the **EXTRACT** operator to identify the month if each visit.  I then used a simple **COUNT** and **GROUP BY** operation to count the visit_ids per month.
    
````  
    SELECT EXTRACT (MONTH FROM event_time) AS month, COUNT (DISTINCT visit_id) AS unique_visit_ids
    FROM clique_bait.events
    GROUP BY (month)
    ORDER BY month;

````

| month | unique_visit_ids |
| ----- | ----- |
| 1     | 876   |
| 2     | 1488  |
| 3     | 916   |
| 4     | 248   |
| 5     | 36    |

***

**4. What is the number of events for each event type?**

This query used **COUNT** and **GROUP BY** to count the number of events for each event type. 

````
    SELECT event_type, COUNT (event_type) AS num_of_events
    FROM clique_bait.events
    GROUP BY event_type
    ORDER BY event_type;

````
| event_type | num_of_events |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| 1          | 20928         |
| 2          | 8451          |
| 3          | 1777          |
| 4          | 876           |
| 5          | 702           |

**5. What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?**

Despite being a simple percentage calculation, I found this question quite tricky.  Everything I tried returned the result of zero.  After some research, I discovered that this was because the character type of my **SELECT** statments were coming out as intergers, but the result of my division was a decimal number.  I therefore used the **CASE** operator to change the character type to float.  I was then able to multiple this result by 100 to get a percentage number. 

````
    SELECT 
 	   (CAST (COUNT(DISTINCT events.visit_id) AS FLOAT)
     /
  	  (SELECT CAST (COUNT(DISTINCT events.visit_id) AS FLOAT) FROM clique_bait.events) ) *100 AS purchase_percentage
    FROM clique_bait.events JOIN clique_bait.event_identifier ON (event_identifier.event_type=events.event_type)
    WHERE event_identifier.event_name = 'Purchase';

````
| purchase_percentage |
| ------------------- |
| 49.85970819304153   |


***

**6. What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?**

Here I counted the number visits which viewed the checkout page and deducted the number of visits that had a purchase event.  I then divded this number by the total number of vists to the checkout page. As with the previous questions, I used the CAST AS FLOAT operation to calculate the percentage result.  

````
    SELECT 
    	(CAST((SELECT(COUNT(events.visit_id))         
    	FROM clique_bait.events 
    	where page_id = 12) 
              - 
        (COUNT(events.visit_id))AS FLOAT)) 
         	/ 
        (SELECT CAST(COUNT (events.visit_id)AS FLOAT)
        FROM clique_bait.events 
        where page_id = 12) * 100 AS checkout_no_purchase_percentage
          
    FROM clique_bait.events 
    where event_type = 3 ;

````

| checkout_no_purchase_percentage |
| ------------------------------- |
| 15.501664289110796              |

**7. What are the top 3 pages by number of views?**

This was a straight forard question using the **COUNT** function and **WHERE** clause to filter page views.  I then ordered the views in descending order and limited the results to 3.  This gave the top three pages by number of views.  

````
    SELECT
	page_name,
	COUNT(visit_id)
    FROM clique_bait.events
    JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy
    ON (page_hierarchy.page_id = events.page_id) 
    WHERE events.event_type = 1
    GROUP BY page_name
    ORDER BY COUNT(visit_id) DESC
    LIMIT 3;

````

| page_name    | count |
| ------------ | ----- |
| All Products | 3174  |
| Checkout     | 2103  |
| Home Page    | 1782  |


***

**8. What is the number of views and cart adds for each product category?**

This question required the creation of two cte tables, which were then joined together to present both cart adds and page views in the same table.  

    WITH cartadds AS (
    
    	SELECT product_category, COUNT(visit_id) AS cart_adds
    	FROM clique_bait.events JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy ON (page_hierarchy.page_id = events.page_id) 
    	WHERE events.event_type = 2
    	GROUP BY product_category
    
    ), 
    
    pageviews AS (
      SELECT product_category, COUNT(visit_id) AS page_views
      FROM clique_bait.events JOIN clique_bait.page_hierarchy ON (page_hierarchy.page_id = events.page_id) 
      WHERE events.event_type = 1
      GROUP BY product_category
    
    )
    
    SELECT cartadds.product_category, cart_adds, page_views
    FROM cartadds
    JOIN pageviews 
    ON cartadds.product_category = pageviews.product_category;

| product_category | cart_adds | page_views |
| ---------------- | --------- | ---------- |
| Luxury           | 1870      | 3032       |
| Shellfish        | 3792      | 6204       |
| Fish             | 2789      | 4633       |


## Part 2: Product Funnel Analysis

**Using a single SQL query - create a new output table which has the following details:**

How many times was each product viewed?
How many times was each product added to cart?
How many times was each product added to a cart but not purchased (abandoned)?
How many times was each product purchased?
Additionally, create another table which further aggregates the data for the above points but this time for each product category instead of individual products.



Use your 2 new output tables - answer the following questions:

Which product had the most views, cart adds and purchases?
Which product was most likely to be abandoned?
Which product had the highest view to purchase percentage?
What is the average conversion rate from view to cart add?
What is the average conversion rate from cart add to purchase?
