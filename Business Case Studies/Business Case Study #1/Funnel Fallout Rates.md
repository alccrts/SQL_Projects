## Business Problem

This case study is centered around a fictional online food store.  The founder of the company wants to analyse customer data to find creative solutions to calculate funnel fallout rates.  

## Data

The founder has provided five datasets: `users`, `events`, `campaign_identifier`, `page_identifier`, `event_identifier`.  To demonstrate the relationship between the tables, I have created the Entity Relationship Diagram below using the [DB Diagram tool](https://dbdiagram.io/home).  I have analysed the data using PostgreSQL 13 and you can view it at [DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/2rM8RAnq7h5LLDTzZiRWcd/138).

## Questions & Analysis

## Part 1: Digital Analysis

**1. How many users are there?**

To find the total number of users, I ran a simple **COUNT (DISTINCT)** function
````
SELECT
	COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS total_users
FROM	clique_bait.users;
````

| total_users |
| ----------- |
| 500         |


***

**2. How many cookies does each user have on average?**

I created a cte table to first count the number of cookies per users.  I then averaged these results with a seperate **SELECT** statement.  I rounded the result to the nearest whole number because it isn't possible to have anything less than a whole cookie.  

````
    WITH user_count AS (
    
    	SELECT COUNT(cookie_id) AS cookie_count 
    	FROM clique_bait.users
    	GROUP BY (user_id))
       	
        
    SELECT ROUND(AVG(cookie_count),0) AS avg_cookies_per_user
    FROM user_count;
````

| avg_cookies_per_user |
| -------------------- |
| 4                    |
